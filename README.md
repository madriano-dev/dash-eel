# dash-eel
This is a basic dashboard developed using Python and the Eel library, which allows for creating user interfaces (UI) with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while keeping the main logic in Python. The dashboard displays real-time data, with relevant charts and metrics, making visualization and tracking easier and more intuitive.
